## Operators and punctuation

```

The following character sequences represent operators (including assignment operators) and punctuation:

```
+    &     +=    &=     &&    ==    !=    (    )
-    |     -=    |=     ||    <     <=    [    ]
*    ^     *=    ^=     <-    >     >=    {    }
/    <<    /=    <<=    ++    =     :=    ,    ;
%    >>    %=    >>=    --    !     ...   .    :
     &^          &^=          ~
```

## Operators

```

```

Operators combine operands into expressions.

```
Expression = UnaryExpr | Expression binary_op Expression .
UnaryExpr  = PrimaryExpr | unary_op UnaryExpr .

binary_op  = "||" | "&&" | rel_op | add_op | mul_op .
rel_op     = "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" .
add_op     = "+" | "-" | "|" | "^" .
mul_op     = "*" | "/" | "%" | "<<" | ">>" | "&" | "&^" .

unary_op   = "+" | "-" | "!" | "^" | "*" | "&" | "<-" .
```

## Operator precedence

```
Source: Go Spec §Operator precedence
URL:    https://go.dev/ref/spec#Operator_precedence
```

Unary operators have the highest precedence. As the `++` and `--` operators form statements, not expressions, they fall outside the operator hierarchy.

There are five precedence levels for binary operators. Multiplication operators bind strongest, followed by addition operators, comparison operators, `&&` (logical AND), and finally `||` (logical OR):

```
Precedence    Operator
    5             *  /  %  <<  >>  &  &^
    4             +  -  |  ^
    3             ==  !=  <  <=  >  >=
    2             &&
    1             ||
```

Binary operators of the same precedence associate from left to right. For instance, `x / y * z` is the same as `(x / y) * z`.

```
+x                         // x
42 + a - b                 // (42 + a) - b
23 + 3*x[i]                // 23 + (3 * x[i])
x <= f()                   // x <= f()
^a >> b                    // (^a) >> b
f() || g()                 // f() || g()
x == y+1 && <-chanInt > 0  // (x == (y+1)) && ((<-chanInt) > 0)
```
